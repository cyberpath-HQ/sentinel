Installing Sentinel is straightforward using Cargo, Rust's package manager. This guide walks you through adding Sentinel
to your project and configuring the necessary dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Sentinel, ensure you have the following:

- **Rust 1.92 or later**: Sentinel uses modern Rust features and async/await
- **Cargo**: Rust's built-in package manager
- And the easy one, **a filesystem**: Sentinel works on any POSIX-compliant or Windows filesystem

If you don't have Rust installed, get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Adding Sentinel to Your Project

Add Sentinel to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
sentinel-dbms = "^1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde_json = "1"
```

Sentinel is split into two crates:

| Crate             | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sentinel-dbms`   | The main database crate with Store, Collection, and Document     |
| `sentinel-crypto` | Cryptographic utilities (automatically included as a dependency) |

You only need to depend on `sentinel-dbms` directly, it re-exports everything you need from `sentinel-crypto`.

## Async Runtime

Sentinel is fully asynchronous and requires a Tokio runtime. Make sure your `main` function is annotated with
`#[tokio::main]`:

```rust
use sentinel_dbms::Store;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let store = Store::new("./data", None).await?;
    // Your code here
    Ok(())
}
```

If you're integrating Sentinel into an existing application that already has a Tokio runtime, you're all set. Sentinel
will use the existing runtime context.

## Optional Features

Sentinel and its crypto module support different encryption and key derivation algorithms. You can configure which
algorithms to use at runtime through the global crypto configuration:

```rust
use sentinel_dbms::{
    CryptoConfig,
    EncryptionAlgorithmChoice,
    KeyDerivationAlgorithmChoice,
    set_global_crypto_config,
};

fn main() {
    // Configure before any crypto operations
    let config = CryptoConfig {
        hash_algorithm: Default::default(),           // BLAKE3
        signature_algorithm: Default::default(),      // Ed25519
        encryption_algorithm: EncryptionAlgorithmChoice::Aes256GcmSiv,
        key_derivation_algorithm: KeyDerivationAlgorithmChoice::Pbkdf2,
    };

    set_global_crypto_config(config).expect("Config already set");
}
```

## Verifying Installation

Create a simple test to verify everything is working:

```rust
use sentinel_dbms::Store;
use serde_json::json;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a temporary store
    let store = Store::new("./test-data", None).await?;

    // Create a collection
    let test = store.collection("test").await?;

    // Insert a document
    test.insert("hello", json!({ "message": "Sentinel is working!" })).await?;

    // Read it back
    let doc = test.get("hello").await?;
    println!("{:?}", doc);

    // Clean up
    std::fs::remove_dir_all("./test-data")?;

    println!("✓ Sentinel is installed correctly!");
    Ok(())
}
```

Run your project:

```bash
cargo run
```

If you see "Sentinel is installed correctly!" printed, you're ready to go!

## Building from Source

If you want to build Sentinel from source or contribute to development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cyberpath-HQ/sentinel.git
cd sentinel

# Build all crates
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

The repository is organized as a Cargo workspace with multiple crates:

```text
crates/
├── sentinel/          # Main DBMS crate
├── sentinel-crypto/   # Cryptographic utilities
└── cli/               # Command-line interface (coming soon)
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Sentinel installed, continue with the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide to create your first
store and documents.
